== Hands-on #6: Bashoutter

In the sixth and final hands-on session, we will create a simple web service using the serverless cloud technology we have learned so far.
Specifically, let's create a social networking service (SNS), named **Bashoutter**, where people can post their own haiku poems.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku[Haiku]
is a Japanese poetic form where it is consisted of 17 characters divided in to 5,5,7 character phrases.)
By incorporating all the technologies such as Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3, a simple yet scalable social networking service that makes full use of serverless cloud will be born.
By the end of this hands-on, we will deploy a modern-looking SNS shown in <<handson_05_bashoutter>>.

=== Preparation

The source code for the hands-on is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/tree/main/handson/bashoutter[handson/bashoutter].

To run this hands-on, it is assumed that the preparations described in the first hands-on (<<handson_01_prep>>) have been completed.

[WARNING]
====
This hands-on exercise can be performed within the
https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc[free AWS tier].
====

=== Reading the application source code

==== API

In this application, we implement functions such as accepting haiku submissions from people, and retrieving a list of haiku from the database.
As a minimum design to realize this service, we will implement four REST APIs as shown in <<tab_handson_05_api>>.
The APIs for basic data manipulation, such as posting, browsing, and deleting haiku, are provided.
In addition, `PATCH /haiku/{item_id}` is used to "like" the haiku specified by `{item_id}`.

[[tab_handson_05_api]]
[cols="1,1"]
.Bashoutter API
|===
|`GET /haiku`
|Get a list of haiku

|`POST /haiku`
|Post a new haiku

|`PATCH /haiku/{item_id}`
|Like a haiku specified by `{item_id}`

|`DELETE /haiku/{item_id}`
|Delete the haiku specified by `{item_id}`
|===

[TIP]
====
The **Open API Specification** (OAS; formerly known as the Swagger Specification) is a description format for REST APIs.
If the API specification is written according to the OAS, you can easily generate API documentation and client applications.
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/bashoutter/specs/swagger.yml[API specification prepared for this project]
is also written according to the OAS.
For more information, see
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[official Swagger documentation].

[[sec:bashoutter_application]]
==== Application architecture

<<handson_05_architecture>> shows an overview of the application we are creating in this hands-on.

[[handson_05_architecture]]
.Application architecture
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/handson-05-architecture.png[hands-on 05 architecture, 600, align="center"]

The summary of the system design is as follows:

* API requests from the client are first sent to the **API Gateway** (described below), and then forwarded to the Lambda function specified by the API path.
* An independent Lambda function is defined for each API path.
* A database (powered by DynamoDB) is created to record the haiku information (author, text, submission date, etc.).
* Give each Lambda function read and write access to DynamoDB.
* Finally, we create an S3 bucket to deliver the static contents of the web page.
Clients retrive HTML, CSS and JavaScript from this bucket and the contents will be displayed on a web browser.

Now, let us take a look at the main application code
(https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/bashoutter/app.py[handson/bashoutter/app.py])ï¼Ž

[source, python, linenums]

            default_cors_preflight_options=apigw.CorsOptions(
                allow_origins=apigw.Cors.ALL_ORIGINS,

        )
----

<1> Here, a DynamoDB table is created to record the haiku information.
<2> This part creates an S3 bucket to store and deliver the static site contents.
`s3_deploy.BucketDeployment()` configures the settings to automatically upload the necessary files when the stack is deployed.
<3> This part defines the Lambda functions to be executed by each API path.
The functions are written in Python 3.7 and the code can be found at
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/bashoutter/api/api.py[handson/bashoutter/api/api.py].
<4> The Lambda function defined in <3> is given read and write access to the database.
<5> Here, the API Gateway is used to link each API path with the corresponding Lambda function.

==== S3 bucket in Public access mode

Take a closer look at the part of the code where an S3 bucket is created.

[source, python, linenums]
----
bucket = s3.Bucket(
    self, "Bashoutter-Bucket",
    website_index_document="index.html",
    public_read_access=True,
    removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
)
----

What you should pay attention to here is the line `public_read_access=True`.
S3 has a feature called **Public access mode**.
When the public access mode is turned on, the files in the bucket can be viewed without authentication (i.e., by anyone on the Internet).
This setting is ideal for storing static content for public websites, and many serverless web services are designed this way.
When the public access mode is set, a unique URL such as `http://XXXX.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/` is assigned to the bucket.
When a client accesses this URL, `index.html` in the bucket is returned to the client, and the page is loaded
(Note that we are specifying which file to be returned in the line `website_index_document="index.html"`.)

[TIP]
====
When operating a web site for production, it is common to add the service called
https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/[CloudFront]
to the S3 bucket in public access mode.
CloudFront can be used to configure **Content Delivery Nework (CDN)** and encrypted HTTPS communication.
For more information about CloudFront, please refer to
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html[official documentation "What is Amazon CloudFront?].

In this hands-on session, CloudFront configuration was not performed to simplify the code, but readers who are interested may find the program at the following link helpful.

* https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/typescript/static-site
====

[TIP]
====
The public S3 bucket is assigned a random URL by AWS.
If you want to host it in your own domain such as `example.com`, you can configure Domain Name System (DNS), such as Amazon Route 53, and add an appropriate record.
====

After creating an S3 bucket in public access mode, the following code is used to upload the website contents to the bucket upon deployment of the stack.

[source, python, linenums]
----
s3_deploy.BucketDeployment(
    self, "BucketDeployment",
    destination_bucket=bucket,
    sources=[s3_deploy.Source.asset("./gui/dist")],
    retain_on_delete=False,
)
----

With this code, the files in the directory `./gui/dist` will be placed in the bucket when the deployment is started.
The directory `./gui/dist` contains the static contents (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) of the website.
We will not explain the implementation details of the GUI here, but the code can be found at
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/tree/main/handson/bashoutter/gui[handson/bashoutter/gui].
If you are interested, we recommend to read the source code.

[TIP]
====
This website was built using the UI frameworks called
https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js]
and
https://vuetifyjs.com/[Vuetify].
By using Vue, the web page is rendered using single page application (SPA) technology.
====

==== API handler functions

When an API request comes, the function that performs the requested processing is called the handler function.
Let's take a look at the part where the handler function for the `GET /haiku` API is defined in Lambda.

[source, python, linenums]
----
get_haiku_lambda = _lambda.Function(
    self, "GetHaiku",
    code=_lambda.Code.from_asset("api"),
    handler="api.get_haiku",
    memory_size=512,
    **common_params
)
----

Starting from the simplest part, `memory_size=512` specifies the memory allocated for this function as 512MB.
`code=_lambda.Code.from_asset("api")` defines that the source code of the function should be retrieved from an external directory named `api/`.
Then, the line `handler="api.get_haiku"` specifies that `get_haiku()` function from `api.py` should be executed as a handler function.

Next, let's look at the source code of `get_haiku()` function in `api.py`
(https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/bashoutter/api/api.py[handson/bashoutter/api/api.py])ï¼Ž

[source, python, linenums]
----
ddb = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
table = ddb.Table(os.environ["TABLE_NAME"])

def get_haiku(event, context):
    """
    handler for GET /haiku
    """
    try:
        response = table.scan()

        status_code = 200
        resp = response.get("Items")
    except Exception as e:
        status_code = 500
        resp = {"description": f"Internal server error. {str(e)}"}
    return {
        "statusCode": status_code,
        "headers": HEADERS,
        "body": json.dumps(resp, cls=DecimalEncoder)
    }
----

In the line `response = table.scan()`, all the elements are retrieved from the DynamoDB table.
If no error occurs, the status code 200 is returned along with the haiku data, and if any error occurs, the status code 500 is returned.

By repeating the above operations for other APIs, handler functions for all APIs are defined.

[TIP]
====
In the handler function of `GET /haiku`, notice the line `response = table.scan()`.
This is actually not the best way to write a data retrieval from DynamoDB.
The `scan()` method of DynamoDB returns only data up to 1MB in size.
If the size of the data in the database is larger than 1MB, you need to call the `scan()` method recursively.
For more information, refer to
https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html#DynamoDB.Table.scan[the official documentation of boto3 library].
====

[[sec:bashoutter_iam]]
==== Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Look at the following part of the code.

[source, python, linenums]
----
table.grant_read_data(get_haiku_lambda)
table.grant_read_write_data(post_haiku_lambda)
table.grant_read_write_data(patch_haiku_lambda)
table.grant_read_write_data(delete_haiku_lambda)
----

AWS has an important concept called
https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[IAM (Identity and Access Management)].
Although we have not mentioned it so far for the sake of simplicity, IAM is a very important concept in designing the cloud system on AWS.
IAM basically defines what permissions a resource has over other resources.
For example, in its default state, Lambda does not have any permissions to access other resources such as DynamoDB.
Therefore, in order for a Lambda function to read or write DynamoDB data, an IAM must be granted to the Lambda function to allow such operation.

`dynamodb.Table` object in CDK has a convenient method `grant_read_write_data()`, which assigns IAM to other resources so that they can perform read and write operation to the database.
Similarly, the `s3.Bucket` object in CDK has a method `grant_read_write()` to allow reading and writing to the bucket.
Indeed, we used this method in <<sec_aws_batch>> where we granted AWS Batch to write data to S3 bucket.
Interested readers can look back and check the code.

[NOTE]
====
The best practice to manage IAM is that the minimam permissions necessary for the system to work should be assigned to each resource.
This will not only improve security of the system, but also reduce bugs by, for example, preventing unintended resources from reading or writing to the database.
For this reason, the above code grants only read permission to the handler of `GET /haiku` API (notice the use of `grant_read_data()` method instead of `grant_read_write_data()`).
====

==== API Gateway

https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/[API Gateway] is literally an gateway that forwards API requests to Lambda, EC2, and other resources according to the API request path (<<fig:bashoutter_api_ gateway>>).
Then, the outputs of the processing performed by Lambda and EC2 are returned to the client via API Gateway.
In cloud terminology, the server that stands between the client and the backend server whose job is to forward the connection according to the API path is called a **router** or a **reverse proxy**.
Traditionally, routers are usually served by a dedicated virtual server.
API Gateway, on the other hand, is a serverless router service where it achieves routing without a fixed server.
API Gateway is dynamically launched only when the API request arrives.
As a natural consequence of being serverless, it has the ability to automatically increase its routing capacity as the number of accesses increases.

[[fig:bashoutter_api_gateway]]
.API Gateway
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/api_gateway.png[api_gateway, 700, align="center"]

By deploying an API Gateway, one can easily build a system that can handle a large number of API requests (thousands to tens of thousands per second) without having to write codes.
The summary of the API Gateway cost is shown in <<tab_handson_05_apigateway_price>>.
API Gateway also offers free tier, so up to one million requests per month can be used for free.

[[tab_handson_05_apigateway_price]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]

|$4.25

|Next 667 million
|$3.53

|Next 19 billion
|$3.00
|Over 20 billion
|$1.91
|===

Let's look at the source code.

[source, python, linenums]
----
# <1>
api = apigw.RestApi(
    self, "BashoutterApi",
    default_cors_preflight_options=apigw.CorsOptions(
        allow_origins=apigw.Cors.ALL_ORIGINS,
        allow_methods=apigw.Cors.ALL_METHODS,
    )
)

# <2>
haiku = api.root.add_resource("haiku")
# <3>
haiku.add_method(
    "GET",
    apigw.LambdaIntegration(get_haiku_lambda)
)
haiku.add_method(
    "POST",
    apigw.LambdaIntegration(post_haiku_lambda)
)

# <4>
haiku_item_id = haiku.add_resource("{item_id}")
# <5>
haiku_item_id.add_method(
    "PATCH",
    apigw.LambdaIntegration(patch_haiku_lambda)
)
haiku_item_id.add_method(
    "DELETE",
    apigw.LambdaIntegration(delete_haiku_lambda)
)
----

<1> First, an empty API Gateway is created by `api = apigw.RestApi()`.
<2> Next, we add add the API path `/haiku` by calling the method `api.root.add_resource()`.
<3> Next, `add_method()` is called to define the `GET` and `POST` methods for the `/haiku` path.
<4> Similarly, `haiku.add_resource("{item_id}")` adds the API path `/haiku/{item_id}`.
<5> Finally, `add_method()` is used to define `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods in the path `/haiku/{item_id}`.

As you can see, API Gateway is very simple to use.
All you need to do is to sequentially describe the API path and the methods that will be executed.

[TIP]
====
When you create a new API with this program, a random URL will be assigned as the API endpoint.
If you want to host it in your own domain such as `example.com`, you can configure Domain Name System (DNS), such as Amazon Route 53, and add an appropriate record.
====

[TIP]
====
When we created a new API with API Gateway, the parameter `default_cors_preflight_options` was used to set up
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)].
This setting is necessary when accessing the API from a web browser.
====

=== Deploying the application

The deployment procedure is almost the same as the previous hands-on.
Here, only the commands are listed (lines starting with `#` are comments).
If you have forgotten the meaning of each command, review the first hands-on.
You should not forget to set the access key (<<aws_cli_install>>).

[source, bash]
----
# move to the project directory
$ cd intro-aws/handson/bashoutter

# create venv and install dependent libraries
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deploy!
$ cdk deploy
----

If the deployment is successful, you should see an output like <<handson_05_cdk_output>>.
In the output you should find `Bashoutter.BashoutterApiEndpoint = XXXX` and `Bashoutter.BucketUrl = YYYY`.
We will use these string values later, so be sure to make notes of them.

[[handson_05_cdk_output]]
.Output of `cdk deploy`
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/cdk_output.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

Now, let's log in to the AWS console and check the deployed stack.
First, go to the API Gateway page.
You will see a screen like <<handson_05_apigw_console_list>>, where you can check the list of deployed API endpoints.

[[handson_05_apigw_console_list]]
.API Gateway console (1)
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/apigw_console_list.png[apigw_console_list, 700, align="center"]

By clicking on the API named "BashoutterApi", you can move to a screen like <<handson_05_apigw_console_detail>> and view detailed information.
You can see that `GET /haiku`, `POST /haiku`, and other APIs are defined.

Click on each method to see detailed information about that method.
In addition to the aforementioned routing functions, API Gateway can also be used to add authentication.
We won't be using these authentication feature in this hands-on, but this feature will be useful in many web applications.
Next, in <<handson_05_apigw_console_detail>>, notice that the Lambda functions called by this API is shown in the area circled in red.
Clicking on the function name will take you to the console of the corresponding Lambda function, where you can view the contents of the function.

[[handson_05_apigw_console_detail]]
.API Gateway console (2)
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/apigw_console_detail.png[apigw_console_detail, 700, align="center"]

Next, we will move to the S3 console.
There, you should be able to find a bucket whose name starts with `bashouter-XXXX` (where `XXXX` is some random string) (<<handson_05_s3_console>>).

[[handson_05_s3_console]]
.S3 console
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/s3_console.png[s3_console, 700, align="center"]

Let's check the contents of the bucket by clicking on the bucket name.
You will find the main html document, `index.html`, along with `css/`, `js/` and other directories which store the components to render the web page (<<handson_05_s3_contents>>).

[[handson_05_s3_contents]]
.The files in the S3 bucket

[[sec:bashoutter_test_api]]
=== Sending API requests

Now, let's actually send API requests to the deployed application.
First, let's practice sending API requests from the command line.

Here we use a simple HTTP client tool,
https://httpie.org/[HTTPie],
to send HTTP API requests from the command line.
HTTPie is installed together with the Python virtual environment (venv) when we deployed the stack.
To make sure that the installation is successful, activate the virtual environment and type `http` on the command line.
If you get a help message, you are ready to go.

First, set the URL of the API endpoint to a command line variableã€€(the `XXXX` string from `Bashoutter.BashoutterApiEndpoint = XXXX`).

[source, bash]
----
$ export ENDPOINT_URL=XXXX
----

Then, obtain a list of haiku by sending `GET /haiku` API.

[source, bash]
----
$ http GET "${ENDPOINT_URL}/haiku"
----

Unfortunately, there is no haiku registered in the database at this moment, so you will see an empty array (`[]`) as return.

Next, let's post our very first haiku using `POST /haiku`.

[source, bash]
----
$ http POST "${ENDPOINT_URL}/haiku" \
username="Mastuo Bashou" \
first="the stillness" \
second="penetrating the rock" \
third="a cicada's cry"
----

The following output will be obtained.

----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 49
Content-Type: application/json
....
{
    "description": "Successfully added a new haiku"
}
----

It seems we successfully submited a new haiku.
Let's confirm that the haiku is indeed added to the database by calling the GET request again.

[source, bash]
----
$ http GET "${ENDPOINT_URL}/haiku"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 258
Content-Type: application/json
...
[
    {
        "created_at": "2020-07-06T02:46:04+00:00",
        "first": "the stillness",
        "item_id": "7e91c5e4d7ad47909e0ac14c8bbab05b",
        "likes": 0.0,
        "second": "penetrating the rock",
        "third": "a cicada's cry",
        "username": "Mastuo Bashou"
    }
]
----

Excellent!

Next, let's add a "like" to this haiku by calling `PATCH /haiku/{item_id}`.
To do this, run the following command after replacing `XXXX` with the ID of the haiku that you created in the previous command (i.e. `item_id` in the response text).

[source, bash]
----
$ http PATCH "${ENDPOINT_URL}/haiku/XXXX"
----

You should get the output `{"description": "OK"}`.
We confirm that the number of likes has increased by 1 by sending the GET request one more time.

[source, bash]
----
$ http GET "${ENDPOINT_URL}/haiku"
...
[
    {
        ...
        "likes": 1.0,
        ...
    }
]
----

Lastly, we delete the haiku by sending the DELETE request.
Run the following command after replacing `XXXX` with the ID of the haiku.

[source, bash]
----
$ http DELETE "${ENDPOINT_URL}/haiku/XXXX"
----

If we send GET request, the return will be an empty array (`[]`).

Now we were able to validate that the basic APIs for posting, retrieving, deleting, and adding "likes" to haiku are working properly.

=== Simulating a large simultaneous API request

In the previous section, we manually posted haiku one by one.
In a social networking service with a large number of users, several thousand haiku would be posted every second.
By adopting a serverless architecture, we have built a system that can easily handle such instantaneous heavy access.
To demonstrate this point, let's simulate a situation where a large number of APIs are sent to the system.

In
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/bashoutter/client.py[handson/bashoutter/client.py],
we provide a short script to send many API requests simultaneously.
By using this script, we can send `POST /haiku` API request for a specified number of times.

As a test, we will send the API request for 300 times.
Run the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ python client.py $ENDPOINT_URL post_many 300
----

The execution would be completed in a matter of seconds.
If this API had been supported by a single server, it would have taken much longer to process such a large number of requests.
In the worst case, it might have even led to a server shutdown.
The serverless application we have created is a very simple yet scalable cloud system that can handle hundreds of requests every second.
Did you get a glimpse of the benefits and power of a serverless cloud?

[TIP]
====
If you submit a large number of haiku using the above command, the database will be filled with useless data.
To completely empty the database, use the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ python client.py $ENDPOINT_URL clear_database
----

=== Interacting with Bashoutter GUI

In the previous part, we practiced sending APIs from the command line.
In a web application, the exact same thing is done behind a web browser to display the contents of a page (see <<fig:web_server>>).
Lastly, let's see what happens when the API is integrated with the GUI.

Let's check the URL given by `Bashoutter.BucketUrl=` that is output on the command line when we deployed the stack (<<handson_05_cdk_output>>).
As mentioned earlier, this is the URL of the S3 bucket in public access mode.

Open a web browser and enter the URL of S3 in the address bar to access it.
You should see a page like shown in <<handson_05_bashoutter_2>>.

[[handson_05_bashoutter_2]]
.Bashoutter GUI
image::imgs/handson-bashoutter/bashoutter_2.png[bashoutter, 700, align="center"]

When the page is loaded, enter the URL of the **API Gateway** you deployed in the text box at the top that says "API Endpoint URL".
(In this application, the API Gateway URL is randomly assigned, so the GUI is designed like this.)
Then, press the "REFRESH" button on the screen.
If you have already registered some haiku in the database, you will see a list of haiku.
Click on the heart icon at the bottom left of each haiku to give it a "like" vote.

To submit a new haiku, enter the new phrase and the name of the author, then press "POST".
After pressing "POST", be sure to press the "REFRESH" button again to retrieve the latest list of haiku from the database.

=== Deleting the stack

This concludes the Bashoutter project!
We created an SNS that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via the Internet.
As we demonstrated in <<simulating_many_apis>>, Bashoutter can scale flexibly to handle a large number of simultaneous access without delay.
Although it is extremely simple, it satisfies the basic requirements for an modern and scalable web service!

When you have enjoyed Bashoutter application, don't forget to delete the stack.

To delete the stack from the command line, use the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ cdk destroy
----

[WARNING]
====
Depending on the version of CDK, `cdk destroy` may output an error if the S3 bucket is not empty.
In this case, you have to delete all the files in the S3 bucket before deleting the stack.

To do this from the AWS console, go to the S3 console, open the bucket, select all the files, and execute "Actions" -> "Delete".

To do this from the command line, use the following command.
Remember to replace <BUCKET NAME> with the name of your bucket.

[source, bash]
----
$ aws s3 rm <BUCKET NAME> --recursive
----
====

=== Short summary

This is the end of Part III of this book.

In Part III, we focused on how to create web applications and databases that can be used by the general public as an application of cloud computing.
Along the way, we explained the traditional design of cloud systems and the latest design method called serverless architecture.
In <<sec_intro_serverless>>, we practiced serverless architecture in AWS by using Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
Finally, in <<sec_bashoutter>>, we integrated these serverless technologies to create a simple web application called "Bashoutter".

Through these exercises, we hope you have gained a better understanding of how web services are developed and maintained in the real world.
We also hope that this hands-on session was a good starting point for you to create amazing web application yourself.
