== Hands-on #5: Introduction to serverless computing

In the previous chapter, we gave an overview of serverless architecture.
In this chapter, let's learn how to use serverless cloud through hands-on exercises.
In this hands-on session, we will go through three serverless cloud components: Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
A short tutorial is provided for each of them.

=== Lambda hands-on

First, let's learn how to use Lambda.
The source code for the hands-on is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/tree/main/handson/serverless/lambda[handson/serverless/lambda].

A sketch of the application used in this hands-on is shown in <<fig:lambda_deploy>>.
In STEP 1, code written in Python is registered to Lambda using AWS CDK.
Then, in STEP 2, we use the invoke API to launch multiple Lambdas simultaneously to perform parallel computations.
This is a minimal setup for the purpose of experiencing the Lambda workflow.

[WARNING]
====
This hands-on exercise can be performed within the
https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc[free Lambda tier].
====

The program to deploy is written in
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/lambda/app.py[app.py].
Let's take a look at the code.

[source, python, linenums]
----
# <1>
FUNC = """
import time
from random import choice, randint
def handler(event, context):
    time.sleep(randint(2,5))
    sushi = ["salmon", "tuna", "squid"]
    message = "Welcome to Cloud Sushi. Your order is " + choice(sushi)
    print(message)
    return message
"""

class SimpleLambda(Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        # <2>
        handler = _lambda.Function(
            self, 'LambdaHandler',
            runtime=_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_7,
            code=_lambda.Code.from_inline(FUNC),
            handler="index.handler",
            memory_size=128,
            timeout=cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
            dead_letter_queue_enabled=True,
        )
----

<1> Here, we define a function that should be executed by Lambda.
This is a very simple function that sleeps for a random period of 2-5 seconds, then randomly selects one of the strings ["salmon", "tuna", "squid"], and returns a message "Welcome to Cloud Sushi. Your order is XXXX" (where XXXX is the chosen sushi item).
<2> Next, the function written in <1> is registered in Lambda.
The meanings of the parameters are quite obvious, but let us explin for the completeness.
* `runtime=_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_7`:
Here, we want to use Python 3.7 to execute the function defined above.
In addition to Python 3.7, other languages such as Node.js, Java, Ruby and Go are also available.
* `code=_lambda.Code.from_inline(FUNC)`
We specify the code to be executed by Lambda.
Here, the string defined in `FUNC=...` is passed.
You can also pass the path of a file.
* `handler="index.handler"`:
This is a parameter to distinguish between the main and sub functions when the code contains several sub functions.
It means that the function named `handler` should be executed as the main function.
* `memory_size=128`:
Specifies that the maximum memory size is 128MB.
* `timeout=cdk.Duration.seconds(10)`.
The timeout period is set to 10 seconds.
If the function does not finish within 10 seconds, an error is returned.
* `dead_letter_queue_enabled=True`:
This is an advanced setting and is not explained here.

By running the above program, a Lambda function will be created in the cloud.
Now let's deploy it.

==== Deploying the application

The deployment procedure is almost the same as the previous hands-on.
Here, only the commands are listed (lines starting with `#` are comments).
If you have forgotten the meaning of each command, review the first hands-on.
You should not forget to set the access key (<<aws_cli_install>>).

[source, bash]
----
# move to the project directory
$ cd handson/serverless/lambda

# create venv and install dependent libraries
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# deploy!
$ cdk deploy
----

If the deployment command is executed successfully, you should get an output like <<handson_04_lambda_cdk_output>>.
In the output you should see a message `FunctionName = SimpleLambda-XXXX` where `XXXX` is some random string.
We will use this `XXXX` string later, so make a note of it.

[[handson_04_lambda_cdk_output]]
.Output of `cdk deploy`
image::imgs/handson-serverless/handson_04_lambda_cdk_output.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

Let's log in to the AWS console and check the deployed stack.
If you go to the Lambda page from the console, you can see the list of Lambda functions (<<handson_04_lambda_console_func_list>>).

[[handson_04_lambda_console_func_list]]
.Viewing the list of functions from Lambda console
image::imgs/handson-serverless/lambda_console_func_list.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

In this application, we have created a function with a name `SimpleLambda-XXXX`.
Click on the name of the function to see the details.
You should see a screen like <<handson_04_lambda_console_func_detail>>.
In the editor, you can see the Python function that you have just defined in the code.
Scroll down to the bottom of the screen to see the various settings for the function.

[[handson_04_lambda_console_func_detail]]
.Viewing the details of the Lambda function
image::imgs/handson-serverless/lambda_console_func_detail.png[lambda_console_func_detail, 700, align="center"]

[TIP]
====
The code executed by Lambda can also be edited using the editor on the Lambda console screen (<<handson_04_lambda_console_func_detail>>).
In some cases, it is faster to directly edit the code here for debugging purpose.
In this case, do not forget to update the CDK code to reflect the edits you made.
====

==== Executing Lambda function

Now, let's execute (invoke) the Lambda function we have created.
Using the AWS API, we can start executing the function.
Here, we will use the
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/lambda/invoke_one.py[handson/serverless/lambda/invoke _one.py],
which contains a simple code to invoke Lambda function.
Interested readers are recommended to read the code.

The following command invokes a Lambda function.
Replace the `XXXX` part of the command with the string obtained by `SimpleLambda.FunctionName = SimpleLambda-XXXX` when you deployed it earlier.

[source, bash]
----
$ python invoke_one.py SimpleLambda-XXXX
----

After a few seconds, you should get the output `"Welcome to Cloud Sushi. Your order is salmon"`.
It seems like a toy example, but the function was indeed executed in the cloud, where it generated a random number, selected a random sushi item, and returned the output.
Try running this command a few times and see that different sushi menu is returned for each execution.

Now, this command executes one function at a time, but the real power of Lambda is that it can execute a large number of tasks at the same time.
Next, let's try sending 100 tasks at once.
We use a Python script saved as
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/lambda/invoke_many.py[handson/serverless/lambda/ invoke_many.py].

Run the following command.
Remember to replace the `XXXX` part as before.
The second argument, `100`, means to submit 100 tasks.

[source, bash]
----
$ python invoke_many.py XXXX 100
----

The output will be something like below.

[source, bash]
----
....................................................................................................
Submitted 100 tasks to Lambda!
----

Let's confirm that 100 tasks are actually running simultaneously.
Go back to the Lambda console (<<handson_04_lambda_console_func_detail>>), and click on the "Monitoring" tab.
You will see a graph like <<handson_04_lambda_console_monitoring>>.

[[handson_04_lambda_console_monitoring]]
.Monitoring the execution statistics from Lambda console
image::imgs/handson-serverless/lambda_console_monitoring.png[lambda_console_monitoring, 700, align="center"]

[WARNING]
====
It takes some time for the graph shown in <<handson_04_lambda_console_monitoring>> to be updated.
If nothing is shown, wait a while and refresh the graph again.
====

In <<handson_04_lambda_console_monitoring>>, "Invocations" means how many times the function has been executed.
You can see that it has been indeed executed 100 times.
Furthermore, "Concurrent executions" shows how many tasks were executed simultaneously.
In this case, the number is 96, which means that 96 tasks were executed in parallel.
(The reason this does not equal 100 is that the commands to start the tasks were not sent at exactly the same time.)

As we just saw, although it is very simple, using Lambda, we were able to create a cloud system that can execute a task concurrently.

If we tried to do this in a traditional serverful cloud, we would have to write a lot of code for scaling the cluster, and also adjust various parameters.

[TIP]
====
If you are interested, you can try submitting 1000 tasks at once.
You will see that Lambda can handle such a large number of requests.
However, be careful not to overdo it, or you will exceed the free usage limit of Lambda.
====

==== Deleting the stack

Finally, let's remove the stack.
To remove the stack, execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ cdk destroy
----

[[sec:dynamodb_tutorial]]
=== DynamoDB hands-on

Next, let's work on a short tutorial on DynamoDB.
The source code for the hands-on is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/tree/main/handson/serverless/dynamodb[/handson/serverless/dynamodb].

A sketch of the application used in this hands-on is shown in <<fig:dynamodb_deploy>>.
In STEP 1, we deploy an empty DynamoDB tables using AWS CDK.
Then, in STEP 2, we practice basic operations such as writing, reading, and deleting data from the database using the API.

[[fig:dynamodb_deploy]]
.Overview on DynamoDB tutorial
image::imgs/handson-serverless/dynamodb_deploy.png[dynamodb_deploy, 700, align="center"]


[WARNING]
====
This hands-on exercise can be performed within the
https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc[free DynamoDB tier].
====

The program to deploy is written in
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/dynamodb/app.py[handson/serverless/dynamodb/app.py].
Let's take a look at the code.

[source, python, linenums]
----
class SimpleDynamoDb(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        table = ddb.Table(
            self, "SimpleTable",
            # <1>
            partition_key=ddb.Attribute(
                name="item_id",
                type=ddb.AttributeType.STRING
            ),
            # <2>
            billing_mode=ddb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
            # <3>
            removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        )
----

With this code, an empty DynamoDB table with the minimum configuration is created.
Let us explain the meanings of each parameter.

<1> Here we define **partition key** of the table.
Every DynamoDB table must have a partition key.
The partition key is a unique ID for each element (record) in the table.
Every record in the table must have a partition key.
There cannot be more than one element with the same partition key in a table.
(except for the case where sort Key is used. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html[official documentation "Core Components of Amazon DynamoDB"]).
In this example, the partition key is named `item_id`.
<2> Here we specify the `billing_mode` parameter.
By specifying `ddb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST`, DynamoDB table in **on-demand capacity mode** is created.
There is another mode called `PROVISIONED`, but this is for more advanced use cases.
<3> Here we specify the `removal_policy`.
It specifies whether DynamoDB table will be removed together when the CloudFormation stack is deleted.
In this code, `DESTROY` is selected, so all the data will be deleted.
If you select other options, you can define other behaviors such as keeping DynamoDB backups even if the stack is deleted.

[[sec:serverless_dynamodb_deploy]]
==== Deploying the application

The deployment procedure is almost the same as the previous hands-on.
Here, only the commands are listed (lines starting with `#` are comments).
If you have forgotten the meaning of each command, review the first hands-on.
You should not forget to set the access key (<<aws_cli_install>>).

[source, bash]
----
# move to the project directory
$ cd handson/serverless/dynamodb

# create venv and install dependent libraries
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# deploy!
$ cdk deploy
----

If the deployment command is executed successfully, you should get an output like <<handson_04_dynamodb_cdk_output>>.
In the output you should see a message `TableName = XXXX` where `XXXX` is some random string.
We will use this `XXXX` string later, so make a note of it.

[[handson_04_dynamodb_cdk_output]]
.Output of `cdk deploy`
image::imgs/handson-serverless/handson_04_dynamodb_cdk_output.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

Let's log in to the AWS console and check the deployed stack.
From the console, go to the DynamoDB page and select "Tables" from the menu bar on the left.
Then, you can see the list of tables in a screen like <<handson_04_dynamodb_table_list>>.

[[handson_04_dynamodb_table_list]]
.Viewing the list of DynamoDB tables
image::imgs/handson-serverless/dynamodb_table_list.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

The deployment will createa a table with a random name starting with `SimpleDynamoDb`.
Click on the name of the table to see the details.
You should see a screen like <<handson_04_dynamodb_table_detail>>.
Click on the "Items" tab to see the records in the table.
At this point, the table is empty because no data has been written to it.

[[handson_04_dynamodb_table_detail]]
.Viewing the details of the DynamoDB table
image::imgs/handson-serverless/dynamodb_table_detail.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

==== Read and write operations

Now, let's practice read and write operations using the table that we just created.
Here we will use Python and
https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html[boto3]
library.

First, we write a new record in the table.
Open the file named
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/dynamodb/simple_write.py[simple_write.py]
in the hands-on directory.
Inside the program, you will find the following code.

[source, python, linenums]
----
import boto3
from uuid import uuid4
ddb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

def write_item(table_name):
    table = ddb.Table(table_name)
    table.put_item(
    Item={
        'item_id': str(uuid4()),
        'first_name': 'John',
        'last_name': 'Doe',
        'age': 25,
        }
    )
----

If you read the code from the top, you will see that it first imports the boto3 library and then calls the `dynamodb` resource.
The `write_item()` function takes the name of the DynamoDB table as an argument.
Then, the `put_item()` method is called to write a new record to the DB.
The item has four attributes defined: `item_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`.
The `item_id` corresponds to the partition key described above, and is given a random string using
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[UUID4]
algorithm.

Now, let's run `simple_write.py`.
Replace "XXXX" with the name of the table you deployed (a string starting with `SimpleDynamoDb`), and then execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ python simple_write.py XXXX
----

Let's check from the AWS console that the new record has been written correctly.
Use the same procedure as <<handson_04_dynamodb_table_detail>> to display the list of records in the table.
You will find a new record as expected, as shown in <<fig:dynamodb_table_new_item>>.

[[fig:dynamodb_table_new_item]]
.Viewing the newly added record in the DynamoDB table
image::imgs/handson-serverless/dynamodb_table_new_item.png[cdk output, 700, align="center"]

It is also possible to use boto3 to read elements from a table.
Open the file named
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/dynamodb/simple_read.py[simple_read.py]
in the hands-on directory.

[source, python, linenums]
----
import boto3
ddb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

def scan_table(table_name):
    table = ddb.Table(table_name)
    items = table.scan().get("Items")
    print(items)
----

By calling `table.scan().get("Items")`, all the records in the table are read out.

Let's run this script with the following command
(Don't forget to replace the "XXXX" part correctly).

[source, bash]
----
$ python simple_read.py XXXX
----

You should get an output showing the record we just added eariler.

==== Reading and writing a large number of records

The advantage of DynamoDB is that, as mentioned at the beginning, its processing capacity can be freely expanded according to the load.

To test the capability of DynamoDB, let's simulate the situation where a large amount of data is written at once.
In
https://github.com/tomomano/learn-aws-by-coding/blob/main/handson/serverless/dynamodb/batch_rw.py[batch_rw.py],
we have a short script to perform massive write operation to the database.

Run the following command (be sure to replace XXXX with the name of your table).

[source, bash]
----
$ python batch_rw.py XXXX write 1000
----

This command generates a thousand random data, and writes them to the database.

Furthermore, let's search the database.
In the previous command, a random integer from 1 to 50 is assigned to the attribute `age` in each data.
To search and retrieve only those elements whose `age` is less than or equal to 2, you execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ python batch_rw.py XXXX search_under_age 2
----

Let's try running the above two commands several times to apply a simulated load to the database.
You should see that the results are returned without any significant delay.

==== Deleting the stack

When you have had enough fun with DynamoDB, remember to delete the stack.

As in the previous hands-on sessions, you can delete the stack by executing the following command.

[source, bash]
----
$ cdk destroy
----

[[sec:s3_tutorial]]
=== S3 hands-on
